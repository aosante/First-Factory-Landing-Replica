            <p>
              Long story short: We are going to do an excellent job. Since we
              aren’t just another development shop, we start by figuring out
              what your company needs. Whether you work for a major enterprise
              or a smaller, nonprofit corporation, we quickly adapt to your
              existing processes and team while making strategic recommendations
              along the way.

                You may have a need for developers and you are looking for
                incredible talent to extend your team. Maybe you are hoping to
                get some short-term or long-term assistance, or are having
                difficulties finding enough local, qualified people. Whatever
                the reason, our talented software engineers can help to make
                your team complete. We can talk logistics and figure out an
                exact match that works for you.

                Our nearshore development office in Costa Rica operates only 1-2
                hours behind Eastern Time, which allows us to be heavily
                involved in your day-to-day operations. We can join your video
                conferences and phone calls, all during your regular business
                hours. We are also just a 5-hour flight from NYC, and we welcome
                our clients to visit our team in Costa Rica.

              We are here to provide top-notch, custom software development and
              efficient staff augmentation for your development needs.
            </p>

              <h3>A Creative Team</h3>
              <p>
                Our developers aren't just talented, they also have a lot of
                incredible ideas to bring to the table. We hire team members who
                aren't afraid to speak up when they see something that could be
                improved upon. When you hire First Factory to handle your
                development needs, we ensure that you get far more than just a
                software vendor. Our team is your team, and we make sure it is
                the best team we can provide.

              <p>
                You’ve heard that you get what you pay for. Our goal is to
                provide the best quality for what our clients need, without
                driving up unnecessary costs. We do this by not over-engineering
                projects or creating busy-work that wouldn’t be useful for our
                clients in the end. We wholeheartedly believe that our work
                speaks for itself.

                While we do have a safe and overly-secure office in Costa Rica,
                we want our team to feel like a family. We make sure the open
                office environment is able to provide every resource needed to
                our team and allows us to have as much communication as
                possible. We value the trust our clients have in our abilities
                and in our specific team members, and we’d love for you to get
                to know us soon.
