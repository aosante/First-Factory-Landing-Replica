            <p>
              Long story short: We are going to do an excellent job. Since we
              arenâ€™t just another development shop, we start by figuring out
              what your company needs. Whether you work for a major enterprise
              or a smaller, nonprofit corporation, we quickly adapt to your
              existing processes and team while making strategic recommendations
              along the way.

                You may have a need for developers and you are looking for
                incredible talent to extend your team. Maybe you are hoping to
                get some short-term or long-term assistance, or are having
                difficulties finding enough local, qualified people. Whatever
                the reason, our talented software engineers can help to make
                your team complete. We can talk logistics and figure out an
                exact match that works for you.

                Our nearshore development office in Costa Rica operates only 1-2
                hours behind Eastern Time, which allows us to be heavily
                involved in your day-to-day operations. We can join your video
                conferences and phone calls, all during your regular business
                hours. We are also just a 5-hour flight from NYC, and we welcome
                our clients to visit our team in Costa Rica.
